Pattern generation in computer graphics provides vast amounts of precise and aesthetically pleasing digital content. However, supporting artists with meaningful digital tools for creative content generation is an ongoing research challenge. On an algorithmic level, most solutions focus on adding singular features and control mechanisms such as an example-based control or a brush. Little attention has been paid to an overall creative workflow, which needs to balance between giving users as much control as needed without burdening them with unwanted details.  
We review recent methods in the scope of 2D creative pattern generation and their control mechanisms, with particular focus on procedural methods.

\bb{User-assisted pattern generation }
\legie{User-assisted sounds off to me in this context. It would need to be an adjective that fits to design problem - with design as in visual/aesthetic pattern design.} 
\legie{Inventive pattern generation?} is a complex design problem because, on the one hand, the repetitive nature of a pattern is well-matched with algorithmic creation, but on the other hand, control mechanisms beyond automation need to be given to artists for adaptable designs. 
We classify control for a creation process as (1) how is input given by an artist, (2) what type of content does an artist input, (3) where does the input have an effect spatially on the canvas and (4) when can input be given in the timeline of the creation process? Next, we categorize control mechanisms, on an algorithmic level, and on their input modes and primary effect on exemplars, parameterization, handling, filling, guiding, and placing interactions. We organize our analysis of the state of the art along these categories as well as based on the pattern design features they enable, such as repetition, frames, curves, directionality or single visual accents. The focus on design features allows for the integration and comparison of various techniques, such as procedural and data-driven approaches. For a better understanding of the potential of the current techniques for creative creation and for making such an investigation more manageable, we motivate our discussion on the creative means of navigation, transparency, variation, and stimulation. 
We conclude our review by identifying possible new directions that have the potential to inspire innovation for artist-centered creation processes and algorithms.

    % Supporting artists with meaningful digital tools for creative creation is an ongoing research challenge and spans over various disciplines. On an algorithmic level, most solutions focus on adding singular features and control mechanisms. Little attention is paid to novel methods that can complement each other as part of a cohesive pipeline and creative workflow. Towards the goal of enabling a creative workflow, we survey current methods in the scope of creative pattern generation and their control mechanisms. We classify techniques and discuss their potential to support creative creation with newly developed criteria.

    % The specific goal of two-dimensional and creative pattern generation, offers a complex design challenge. On the one hand, the repetitive nature of a pattern is well represented with algorithmic creation, especially with procedural representations. On the other hand, the design space of possible pattern designs ranges from realistic, over abstracted to artistic. Here, considerations about a creative workflow and the need to go beyond automation rise and meaningful control needs to be given to artists. Typically however, with the power of procedural generation comes difficult controllability. Combining the algorithmic nature of procedural generation with novel forms of controllability has great capabilities and potential to offer truly novel benefits to traditional creation processes.

    % For analyzing the state of the art and a better understanding of creative creation with digital tools, we dissect a creation process into to the methodologies of how, what, where and when. To relate control mechanisms on algorithmic level to the stages of a creation process, we classify specific control mechanisms into exemplars, parameterization, handling, filling, guiding and placing interactions. For making the domain of creative creation more manageable, the creative means of navigation, transparency, variation and stimulation are defined and linked to the control mechanisms.
    % \newline
    
    % With these criteria, we survey the most recent algorithmic representations for creative pattern generation. For this chosen design goal, the analysis bridges between various techniques such as procedural and data-driven approaches. We identify open issues and sketch out promising research directions towards the unification of different building blocks to a coherent pipeline. All in all, we hope to inspire innovation for artist-centered creation processes on a grander scheme.
