\section{Introduction}
Pattern generation in computer graphics provides vast amounts of precise and aesthetically pleasing digital content. However, despite over three decades of research, supporting artists with meaningful digital tools for creative content generation is an ongoing research challenge. On an algorithmic level, however, most solutions focus on adding singular features and control mechanisms such as an example-based control or a brush. Little attention has been paid to an overall creative workflow, which needs to balance, giving users as much power as needed without burdening them with unwanted details. Also, techniques are often claimed to be artist-controllable but are less often proven to be so.

% WHY IS THIS A DIFFICULT PROBLEM
Most research has been executed without direct and continuous collaboration with artists and large-scale user studies. Algorithms and methods are being developed mostly because they can be created, for example, because of state of the art in deep learning research \legie{<- I don't understand the first part of the sentence.}, and there is too little common understanding in the research community regarding what artist needs are and how mechanisms are validated.

\legie{The next paragraph feel like a jump topic-wise, needs some form of connection.}
The underlying regularity of 2D pattern designs is based on a repetitive and balanced distribution of elements, usually following hierarchical structures. These characteristics can be efficiently implemented by procedural approaches that arrange elements in space according to generative rules~\cite{stava_2010_ipm}. \legie{This mentioning of inverse modeling feels abrupt, needs motivation.} Inverse procedural models' primary motivation is to free the artist from tedious, non-inspiring, and repetitive tasks. Computational generation techniques are not only an easement, but they also perform in a potentially more precise and less error-prone way than a human artist. Hence, procedural representations are an ideal basis for creative pattern generation. 
% Much effort has gone into investigating control mechanisms for procedural representations within specific contexts, as procedural models are notoriously difficult to control~\cite{bourque_2004_ptm,lagae_2010_pis,gilet_2010_ias,benes_2011_gpm,lasram_2012_ssf,lasram_2012_ptp}.
However, the creative demands of, for example, laying out space-specific designs and placing highlights must also be considered. Procedural models must be augmented, and different approaches must be unified to enable the control and quality of manual creation and the efficiency and accuracy of computation~\cite{gieseke_2017_ooo}. 

We review recent advances in 2D automatic pattern generation. We discuss procedural models, data-driven generation, and design-specific pattern generation. As theoretical grounding, we classify control mechanisms and their characteristics from the perspective of an artist from global to local and from automatic to manual, with varying levels of abstraction for their handling. As a basis for a discussion of the capabilities of control mechanisms in a creative process and their potential for innovative creation, we review the literature on creativity and summarize aspects that can help to understand such capabilities in the context of computer graphic publications.

We organize contemporary techniques by design areas and the visual features they enable. We further group related work by commonly used control types. Then, we specifically analyze for each reference the offered control for an artist. 
%BB this is too detailed for an intro. I would not put the reference to the table here. 
%Our review is summarized in Table~\ref{table:control_mechanisms}, where we organize recent techniques by design areas and the visual features they enable on the y-axis and list for each work the specific control mechanisms they offer on the x-axis. 
We conclude the review with a discussion of the creative means for the different control mechanism types.

%\bb{We review recent advances in 2D pattern generation, and we focus on methods that include a certain level of automatic generation. We discuss procedural models, data-driven generation, design-specific pattern generation. We cross-analyze these methods from the viewpoint of control: example-based, shapes and masks, vector fields, and curves, and sketches.}
The review does not focus on 3D modeling. For 3D generation techniques, the interested reader is referred to the surveys of world building~\cite{smelik_2014_aso, aliaga_2016_ipm}, terrain modeling~\cite{galin_2019_aro} and game-specific approaches~\cite{hendrikx_2013_pcg, togelius_2011_sbp}.

%BB some people hate the overview of the paper at the end of the Introduction. I would save some space by not including it. By all means, we already described it above. 
%\legie: I actually do hate them but thought that it might help this paper as the flow of the paper is a bit unusual. But we can decide later on whether to use it or now.

%We start this survey with a summary of relevant terms~\Cref{terminology}. \Cref{sec:taxo_control_mechanism} lays the theoretical groundwork for our later evaluation of control mechanisms of state of the art by classifying general control characteristics and identifying the specific control mechanisms that associate with these characteristics. We add to this preparatory work in~\Cref{sec:creativ_means} with a basis for enabling a discussion of the creative means for a technique. Before turning to the analysis of the state of the art in~\Cref{sec:analysis}, we establish in~\Cref{sec:design} the areas of investigation by describing possible design features of creative pattern generation and their underlying creation models in~\Cref{sec:models}. Lastly, we discuss future trends and give an outlook to relevant topics in~\Cref{sec:outlook} and conclude the survey in~\Cref{sec:conclusion}.
